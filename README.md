# Typing Speed Test

This is a simple Python script that allows you to test your typing speed by measuring the time it takes to type a given prompt. It then calculates and displays your typing speed in words per minute (WPM).

## Usage

1. Run the `typing_speed_test.py` script using a Python interpreter.
2. The program will display a prompt for you to read and type.
3. When you're ready, press Enter to start the typing test.
4. After typing the prompt, the program will display your typing speed.

## Features

- Measures typing speed by calculating words per minute (WPM).
- Provides immediate feedback on the time taken, words typed, and typing speed.

## Example

Type the following:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
Press Enter when you are ready...
Start typing: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

Time taken: 5.60 seconds
Words typed: 9
Typing speed: 96.43 WPM


## Note

This is a basic typing speed test example. It doesn't take accuracy into account and doesn't provide advanced features found in professional typing tests.
